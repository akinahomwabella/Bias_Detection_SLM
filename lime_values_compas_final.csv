71,priors_count <= 0.00,-0.0680050845625399,Income>=50k,COMPAS,"The feature 'priors_count <= 0.00' represents the number of prior convictions a person has. In this case, it indicates that a person has no prior convictions. The influence score of -0.07 suggests that this feature had a negative impact on the prediction of 'Income>=50k'. This means that individuals with no prior convictions were more likely to be predicted as having an income greater than or equal"
71,juv_misd_count <= 0.00,-0.0586540196666366,Income>=50k,COMPAS,"The feature 'juv_misd_count <= 0.00' in the COMPAS dataset represents the number of times a juvenile offender has been found guilty of a misdemeanor. The feature has an impact score of -0.06 on the prediction 'Income>=50k', indicating that a lower count of misdemeanors is associated with a higher likelihood of having an income above $50,000."
71,decile_score <= 2.00,-0.0520840967904336,Income<=50k,COMPAS,"In the COMPAS dataset, the feature 'decile_score <= 2.00' refers to the range of scores below the second decile. This feature influenced the prediction by indicating that individuals with scores below the second decile were more likely to be incarcerated. However, this feature might introduce bias as it assumes that individuals with lower scores are more likely to commit crimes, which may not necessarily be true. This bias could lead"
137,age > 44.00,-0.0664643586469753,Income>=50k,COMPAS,"The feature 'age > 44.00' had a negative impact score of -0.07, indicating that it had a slightly negative influence on the prediction 'Income>=50k'. This means that as the age of an individual increases beyond 44 years, the likelihood of their income being greater than or equal to $50,000 decreases slightly.

The potential bias associated with this feature is that it may introduce a gender bias."
137,priors_count <= 0.00,-0.0652051077705828,Income<=50k,COMPAS,"The feature 'priors_count <= 0.00' indicates the number of prior convictions the individual had. In this case, it means that the individual had no prior convictions. The negative impact score of -0.07 suggests that having no prior convictions is associated with a lower probability of being involved in criminal activity and being incarcerated.

However, this feature may introduce bias into the prediction. It implies that individuals with no"
137,juv_other_count <= 0.00,-0.0621014030082906,Income<=50k,COMPAS,"The feature 'juv_other_count <= 0.00' indicates the number of individuals who are juvenile offenders but do not belong to any other category. In this case, the impact score of -0.06 suggests that this feature had a negative influence on the prediction of whether the individual's income is less than or equal to $50,000. It implies that individuals with no juvenile offenders among them were more likely"
