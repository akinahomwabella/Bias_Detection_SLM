0,age,-1.721075194161385,Income>=50k,Adult,"The negative SHAP value of -1.72 for the 'age' feature indicates that the model assigned a lower predicted probability of 'Income>=50k' to individuals with higher ages. This suggests that the model may be biased against older individuals, as it tends to underestimate their income potential.

1,age,0.5103806753316894,Income>=50k,Adult,"The SHAP value of 0.51 indicates that the feature 'age' had a significant impact on the model's prediction. This means that as the age of the individual increases, the predicted probability of having an income greater than or equal to $50,000 also increases. However, it is important to consider whether this relationship is fair and unbiased. If the model is trained on a dataset that is not representative of the population, it may introduce bias by favoring certain age"
